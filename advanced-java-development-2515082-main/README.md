You’re comfortable with the basics of writing in Java, but you want to level up your skills and be more productive. In this course, Bethan Palmer has exactly what you need, with topics including generics, multi-threading, inputs and outputs, and more. After explaining the differences between versions of Java, Bethan dives into generics in Java, advanced data structures, and functional programming. She covers concurrency in Java, including how to use the Runnable interface, the ExecutorService, and synchronized methods. Bethan highlights topics around input and output like reading from System.in with a scanner, reading files with BufferedReader, and using try-with-resources. She also guides you through working with files in Java, creating a new file, working with directories, and copying files in Java. Each chapter includes challenges and solutions to reinforce what you’re learning.

## Instructions
All of the code needed for this course is on the main branch. 

The package names correspond to the videos in this course. The naming convention is _CHAPTER#_MOVIE#. As an example, the package named _02_03 corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter.

Some code examples will have a before and an end state. In this case the package will contain two more directories, `before` and `end`. The `before` directory will contain the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `end` directory contains the code as it is at the end of the movie.


## Installing
1. To use these exercise files, you must have Java 8 or higher installed.
2. Clone this repository into your local machine using the terminal (Mac), CMD (Windows), or a GUI tool like SourceTree.
3. Open the code in your favorite IDE.
